I am open to any and all contributions that you feel would improve the project, however there is a list of things to do in the issues section on GitHub.

Any feature requests or bugs should be added to the issues section.

Any branches created should have a name in the form {your-initials}-{short-description-of-change} e.g. jk-update-md.

Feel free to create a pull request for review, or alternatively get in touch using the details at the bottom of the README.
